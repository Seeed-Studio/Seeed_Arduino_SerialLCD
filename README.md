Grove - Serial LCD V1.0 is the new version of our serial LCDs. Attached on a single board is a 16x2 LCD and an embedded circuit based around a PIC HD44780. The on-board PIC takes a TTL serial input and prints the characters it receives onto the LCD. The library also allows for a number of special commands so you can clear the screen, adjust the backlight brightness, turn the display on/off, and more.

This LCD makes for a great gift, because it can be used for so many different projects!
